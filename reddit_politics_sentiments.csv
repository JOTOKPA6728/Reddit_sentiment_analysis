# Trump’s Plane Grounded After Emergency Landing—Now He’s Flying Jeffrey Epstein’s Jet

>The 16-passeger, 2008 model aircraft, was acquired by Epstein in 2013 and was used primarily to fly between Palm Beach, Manhattan, Paris and the US Virgin Islands. Here are redacted customs records for the aircraft. While it was the aircraft used by Epstein prior to his final arrest and death, it was not the ‘Lolita Express’ which was an older Boeing 727.

>While an aircraft that was sold during the pandemic, and available for charter, it seems like a great failure of vetting by the Trump campaign not just because of Epstein’s history (and the nefarious uses of the aircraft itself) but because of Trump’s own past association with Epstein – associations which, to be clear, were notoriously bipartisan.

Transcript: 

VANCE: Well, first of all, Dana, my heart breaks for this woman. I don't know her personally. I have certainly heard the story and our heart breaks for her. And we want people to have healthy, happy families. And it's extremely unfortunate that sometimes, you know, medicine, the act of God, whatever, happens, it just doesn't work out.  
  
And what the president has said, I think, very clearly, is that he is not trying to prevent women who have nonviable pregnancies from getting access to the medical care that they...  
  
BASH: But allowing...  
  
VANCE: ... need.  
  
BASH: But allowing the states to decide, a place like Texas, which has very strict laws now, doesn't allow a Kate Cox to end a pregnancy that is fatal and could potentially hurt her ability to have more kids.  
  
VANCE: Well, but what President Trump has said is that we are going to let voters make these decisions. And, again, Texas might have a view that President Trump disagrees with. They might have a view that President Trump agrees with, but you've got to let the voters make these decisions.  
  
BASH: So you're comfortable...  
  
VANCE: And ultimately...  
  
BASH: ... with that law in Texas?  
  
VANCE: I'm not comfortable with anything, Dana, because I'm not passing judgment on what these laws should be.  
  
Now, you asked me my own personal view. I campaigned against an Ohio referendum. But I think that we have to let voters decide. And when they speak their mind, you have to be respectful. Agree or disagree, with whatever voters decide, they're going to make these decisions.",1,1723475909.0,sadness

"Trafalgar trying to account for ""shy Trump voters"" in 2020 was silly - maybe some people in their day to day life, especially in blue cities, didn't go around wearing red hats and waving Trump flags but the idea that Trump voters were so afraid of being cancelled and/or so desperate to stick it to the fake news that they all lied to pollsters in large numbers, numbers large enough to effect every major pollster, was delusional.

Attempting to account for a shy Trump voter in 2024 is downright idiotic.  A month ago Republicans would tell you they've seen MAGA hats in blue cities and nobody is afraid to admit their support for Trump both after an assassination attempt AND with the incumbent having a very low approval rating.  You mean to tell me the voters all ran back into hiding and went back to lying to pollsters?

In Arizona, early voting starts in 60 days.  In Michigan, mail-in voting starts in 47 days.  In North Carolina, absentee ballots will be sent in just 27 days.

*And every day matters.* 

And we have — and we have some hard work ahead of us.  But I know who’s here.  We like hard work.  Hard work is good work.  (Applause.)  **Hard work is good work**, and together, in November, that’s why we’re going to win. 

But let’s not take anything for granted.  I know there’s **a lot of enthusiasm** out there. 

And, you know, I’ve never been one to really believe in the polls, whether they’re up or they’re down.  What we know is the stakes are so high and we can take nothing for granted in this critical moment. 

So, **we will fuel our campaign**,

as we have, with enthusiasm and optimism but also with **a deep commitment to the hard work it’s going to take.** 

And this campaign, that being said, is really about the fact that, you know, there are, I think, two different — very — visions for our nation that are being presented in this campaign:

one focused — ours — on the future

"*Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump were part of the same social circles in New York and Florida, often seen together at events in the 1990s and early 2000s. Trump once praised Epstein as a “terrific guy” in a 2002 interview, acknowledging a 15-year acquaintance. Following Epstein’s legal issues, Trump distanced himself, claiming they hadn’t spoken in years and that he was not a fan of Epstein. Jeffrey Epstein’s life was a complex tapestry: he started as a math teacher, transitioned into finance where he managed vast wealth, and dabbled in philanthropy, particularly in scientific research. His real estate investments included properties in prime locations and even private islands. Yet, these endeavors are heavily overshadowed by his criminal actions, which have become the most defining and infamous aspects of his story. Epstein died by suicide in his jail cell in 2019, amidst legal proceedings for sex trafficking charges.*

More intriguing IMO are the suggestions in the Guardian about using criminal law. I'm not familiar enough with UK law to say if criminal charges would be supported, but if so, that would certainly get Musk's attention in a way that civil enforcement wouldn't.

"Oof, thing is, the TONE is really different in this photo too. First photo just looked like a Halloween photo, like maybe he lost a bet or dressed up and was being silly and someone snapped a photo. Truly nothing of note if not for the GOP making any sort of gender exploration into a moral panic issue.

But this one? This one leads me to believe the dress up may have been \*actual\* gender exploration, not just a lost bet or a Halloween costume. Why? He's not smiling.

If it was a lost bet or a costume, these photos would probably have him smiling or looking bashful or exasperated at the camera, for example. But this photo? This photo looks sincere. This looks like someone with not a lot of resources (see the cheap Halloween wig) trying out a bit of glamour, exploring ideas of beauty which btw, my heart absolutely goes out to and I would vigorously defend this person from mockery on those grounds.

Even if the conclusion was that he's cis and straight, there's no harm and a lot of good that comes from this sort of exploration. And also consider, Vance isn't conventionally attractive and certainly wasn't then either, so my heart really goes out to someone who wants to explore feeling ""pretty"" and what that means for them.

Vance isn't smiling in this because he's trying to look pretty. These are exploratory photos, there's no smiling, to silliness, the blond wig is awful but that's no fault of someone who doesn't have a lot of money or access. Those clothes look borrowed too, likely from a friend, lending further to the sense of sincere experimentation rather than a Halloween costume (with a Halloween costume, it's more likely you'd wear a cocktail dress or something with a lower neckline, y'know?). This is Vance exploring what Girl Vance would look like and exploring feminine beauty.

\*Sigh\* Again, apologies for the wall of text, but I would have a lot of sympathy for this person and what I think this photo was intended for, a private moment of self exploration and reflection, if not for all the heinous shit and hypocrisy coming out of the GOP he props up right now.

Everyone should be free to safely explore their gender. And to transition if that is what they discover.

"Yeah I don't see ""drag"" here either. There's no flamboyance, as you noted, and not sense of ""fun"" let alone mockery. The high neckline, jewelry, long skirt, etc. likewise to me ring of someone dressing as a woman, possibly the woman they want to be or woman they want to experiment at being, rather than a parody or costume of femininity.

It definitely reminded me of some early exploratory photos by trans women before they come out. In happier timelines, in happier stories, those photos are usually part of the ""early days"" when what looks like a dead-eyed young man who is absolutely miserable with ""his"" life blossoms into an absolutely gorgeous woman who loves her life. (In reference to a more widespread meme I saw to the effect of ""Before/After Photos"" where it's other trans women celebrating and noting how much happier they and others look after transitioning from that ""dead eyed young ""man"" in a hoodie"" to a stunning, happy, contented woman brimming with life, but the full glow-up almost always comes after a few early pictures of clumsy, shy, but sincere explorations as seen in photos like Vance's above). 

Anyway, at risk of another wall of text, I just wanted to agree with you. If you squint, you absolutely see the sort of Instagram pretty girl glamour photo attempt here which is completely harmless and perhaps even deeply meaningful to someone who is exploring their identity and concepts of beauty. I don't see mockery here. Then again, maybe another photo will come out and it will become clear that this all was some sort of joke or horsing around and I'm reading way too much into it.

Perhaps after forcing himself into that mold he feels the need to inflict it on others, since if he has to live a life that makes him unhappy, other should too. Or perhaps not!

Many of even the most conservative cultures throughout history have a culture of dressing up as the opposite sex for fun, be it Ancient Greek comedy plays, Medieval festivals, or even drag shows as entertainment by  US soldiers \*for\* other soldiers in WWII, and it's a testament to how absolutely loony-tunes nuts the right wing has become in the US that a form of expression as old as humanity itself (like drag) is a reason for hysterical moral panic.

I agree. We are no longer competing against a world recovering from a global conflict. We are no longer competing almost exclusively with countries whose economies we eclipse. America no longer has it on easy mode. We have a real chance to revitalize America, but Trump didn't do that. He didn't even try. In his 4 years in office, 2 of which had a GOP controlled Senate & House, the best legislation the Trump admin passed was a piss-ant tax cut for regular people and an absolute *fortune* shoved into the pockets of the already wealthy.

That attracts others to invest, and you use their new investments to keep paying those 20% returns.

"Both of my parents, devout Baptists, masters/PHD graduates, smart and decent people, have voluntarily shut off the part of their brains that handles critical thinking and compassion since 2016. 

Despite knowing history and (for the most part) the Bible, they think Trump was appointed by God. They think COVID was a Chinese genetically engineered virus. They went anti-vax in the pandemic, even though mom has been a nurse for decades. They were both hospitalized AFTER the vaccine was available, dad was in the ICU for weeks and almost certainly shortened his life. 

They're convinced the 2020 election was ""stolen"" and 2024 will be ""stolen again."" Which isn't stopping them from voting, even in Texas where their vote is basically pointless.

"It's so true, man. In my lifetime, my dad voted Clinton, Gore, Kerry, Obama, Obama, and then...Trump, Trump. 

Fox News and right wing misinformation has taken my dad from me. We can't have a conversation without politics coming up. I can't tell him great things happening to me without him coming at it with a right wing slant. It's unbearable, so I've kind of cut him out of my life. He HAS to talk about big social issues happening in other countries. He HAS to read the news headlines aloud on Yahoo/Fox and ask what I think about them. We can be having a beer on the back patio during my rare visit back home and he has to bring up how his job is making them do unnecessary workplace sensitivity training...

I told him a few months ago I got a promotion at work and I was very happy about it. He said congrats and it's good I got the promotion since the cost of everything is going up and illegal immigrants are going to be taking more jobs, making it more difficult for REAL americans to stay gainfully employed. I told him a few months later we bought a house and he said congrats BUT I should've listened to him and waited to buy a house when there was a Republican president since the rates will be better. Like holy shit, just be happy for me.

I have a sliver of hope for this election though - he voted for Haley in the Rep. primary and seemed the slightest bit receptive to change when Biden withdrew. I am hopeful I can convince him to vote for the candidate that will provide a more optimistic future for my child, his grandchild.

We'll see.

I'm 35, AMAB, and married my husband last year.  My parents still don't know.  They might put on an accepting act to our faces when we still had contact, but they made it clear they were always going to vote R.

No matter how many times I told them that they wanted to take my rights away.  My mother straight up told me ""they would never do, they don't have any reason to!""  Then when they straight up put that on their platform ""well they can't!""  Then when Roe was overturned... ""Oh, that's good, actually, because now it's up to states!  Besides, my high school boyfriend was traumatized after he cheated on me by the girl he cheated on me with aborting their baby, so abortion is bad!""  I desperately wish I could say that last bit was exaggerated.  The last few years have been exceptionally bad, and combined with some other stuff... I haven't talked to them in... nearly a year now?

I just can't accept someone claiming to love me, but putting my rights and safety below ""stopping illegals"".

Walz reminds me a lot of the good parts of my dad.  Plain spoken.  Seems exactly the sort to say ""you get me the manual and the parts and I'll fix your car for free"" for friends.  A little goofy, the kind of guy you *know* mooned some people in high school.

I don't think I'll probably ever talk to my dad again at this point.  He's nearly 70 now, and his body is failing badly.  And Walz can't fix that or replace him.  But seeing someone like that entering the national sphere, seeing someone like that bringing the energy needed... it gives me little flashes of hope.  Little bits of the good things again.

Ladies and Gentlemen,



Today, as we stand beneath the expansive skies of our great nation, we are called upon not just to remember the values that once propelled America to the forefront of the world but to act on them. We are the beacon of democracy in a challenging landscape, confronting issues of dictatorship, genocide, and greed. Our response to these challenges will define us for generations to come.



We must safeguard the legacy of innovation, industry, medicine, art, and science—a legacy that is anchored not in the whims of popularity but in unwavering moral courage and decisive action. Our ambition is to be a nation where every individual is valued for their character, where our actions reflect our commitment to lead with integrity both at home and on the global stage.



We have built more than infrastructure in our past; we have laid down the foundations for a society that thrives on justice and prosperity. Yet today, we must face a critical question: Are we living up to the promise of our heritage? Have we allowed the discord of division to silence our better angels?



We must rise above the cynicism and despair that threaten to diminish our spirit. This is not a moment for stepping back but for stepping up, embracing the hard roads that define true leadership, because that is how we forge a future worthy of our past.



Let us recommit ourselves to greatness, driven not by the pursuit of easy victories but by the relentless pursuit of high ideals. This is the promise of America—a promise that says no challenge is too great, no dream too bold if we are united in our effort.



And so, as we move forward, let us channel the spirit of those who chose to go to the moon not because it was easy, but because it was hard, because that goal served to organize and measure the best of their energies and skills. Today, our moonshots are different—climate change, social inequality, educational and technological advancement—but they are no less crucial. They demand the best of us, and we will meet them with the same determination.



Let us not be content with the world as it is; let us be architects of the world as it should be. If we come together, if we listen to one another, we can achieve extraordinary things. We’ve been reminded that change doesn’t come from Washington but to Washington. The most enduring changes are those that come from the power of the people, the strength of our collective will to pursue a brighter tomorrow.



Thank you, and may our shared efforts continue to light the path toward a promising future for the United States of America.",1,1723489701.0,joy

"It’s great to see story like this so high up in the comments. People simplify the division in our country by saying “only idiots vote for Trump/GOP”. We aren’t winning people over by calling people names and we’re also vastly oversimplifying the issue.

My parents are both baptists with masters degrees. Both are New England conservatives, so relative to the rest of the country fairly moderate. My mother even had 2 masters degrees in the field of psychology.

They were reluctant Trump voters in 2016. They just voted for him in the name of “fiscal conservatism”. Since they’ve been retired for the last 4 years though, it’s gotten way worse.

They have thankfully always followed the medical science on COVID but yet they give “injecting disinfectant straight into the body” the excuse of “just a verbal slip up”. 

When January 6th happened I talked to them on the phone and they were outraged. A few days later they were talking about how it was staged by Antifa…

You can tell them straight to their face that they are hearing lies on the news and my dad has legit said to me “they wouldn’t do that” or “they couldn’t get away with that”. They believe Christians and conservatives are “honest hard working Americans”. Being misled like Putin misleads Russians just simply couldn’t happen here in their minds. 

There’s no amount of logic or facts you can use to get them to change a political view, but that’s been the case for a very long time. What’s changed is the extremism and prevalence of those views and their willingness to share them.

The only thing I’ve really made *any* traction on with my father is EVS. He parroted some right wing “EVs catch on fire” memes to me and I went on to explain that I had literally been professionally reading and doing research in the field of reliability and texting of lithium ion batteries as an engineer and could explain things in detail. I told him it was deeply insulting to me that he’d rather listen to a blowhard pundit on TV or some internet meme over his own son who is a scientist and an engineer. He did eventually accept that EVs are reliable, that EVs are somewhat inevitable but it’s only a partially victory because he still says “we still need to drill more and produce more gas vehicles”. He accepts the facts they just don’t really change how he views the world.


The problem isn’t lack of intelligence or compassion. The problem is an emotional one. These people have a world view and an identity. Part of that world view may be being a Christian, a conservative, or a “real American”. Maybe it’s being “fiscally responsible”. That world view believes in American exceptionalism, in freedom, in freedom of speech, and the idea that people are fundamentally honest. It’s deeply engrained and it’s very powerful…

So it doesn’t matter if I tell them facts and get them to agree with my logic. As Einstein said , “A problem can only be solved at the same logical level it was created.” To really change their mind they need to *feel differently* about the world and that is fundamentally a much harder thing to do. This is an emotional problem centered around one’s ego and world view.

I’ve seen the same exact scenario of being able to listen to the facts but being unable to change their perspective when it comes to the topic of mental health. They will accept I have depression and ADHD but they can’t really accept the meaning of that because really truly emotionally accepting it challenges their world view too much. My point is, it’s not just politics.

Right wing media uses fear and it constantly sells the message that their world view and their lifestyle are under attack. They then believe that they are staying true to their beliefs and being courageous standing up for those beliefs. To change their views they need to be willing to change their perception of the world and of themselves and unfortunately that is so so much harder than just sharing facts and using logic.",1,1723491028.0,anger

"I remember all of that, yes, but it never affected the way my parents treated real people in their everyday lives. But I can see how their rigid belief system primed them for the kind of systemic psychological abuse they've been subject to by people who know how to use it. 

For example, my dad taught me all about science concepts like the speed of light, how gravity works, et cetera. He's always been a sci-fi nerd, and he loves hard sci-fi concepts like you get in David Webber books. 

But he was also taught that the Bible is 100% literal truth. Which means the universe is 6,000 years old. It has to be, because that's what the Bible says, discounting any kind of metaphorical or historical interpretation. 

Which means that pretty much every biologist, paleontologist, geologist, etc., all of whom are experts in their field far beyond his very smart layman's understanding, is either grossly incompetent or intentionally lying. And so are most astrophysicists, including the ones who established things he knows to be true, like the speed of light or fundamental forces like gravity. 

The light we see from other galaxies has been travelling for millions of years to reach our telescopes. His solution to this conflict in what he believes and knows to be true? God must have created the light travelling in between galaxies at the same time as the galaxies themselves, six thousand years ago. 

Why would God do that, except to ""fool"" us into thinking the universe is much older than it is? Why wouldn't God simply allow the fundamental principles He established to play out rationally, so we'd have an expanding perspective on the universe approximately 6000 light years around us, only going further as the millennia pass? 

""I'm just a man, I don't understand everything about God. If I did, I'd be God."" 

It's infuriating to know that there are plenty of people who've been able to allow their spiritual beliefs to co-exist with real science using that same argument.

He stopped doing all of those things and started getting angrier and more withdrawn, drinking more than he ever has. The trouble with the outrage-farm propaganda is that if you steep yourself in it 24/7, you will stop feeling like there's much to live for. It's not healthy and not good for your well-being to give up all of your time to invest solely in culture war bullshit, but that's what Fox News has manipulated people into doing. That's why we very deliberately use the word ""cult"" to describe it.

Well yeah, it's a decades-long trend. Two decades ago Republicans were winning TX by 20+ points, in 2020 they won by 4-5.

The argument has always been ""Texas is trending blue. It's gonna take awhile, but it's gonna happen sometime in the 2020s, maybe early 2030s."" It was never ""oh yeah we're gonna turn blue right this year, definitely, no doubt about it. ~four years later~ Oh yeah *now* we're gonna turn blue, no doubt about it. ~four years later~ ok *now* we're gonna..."" 

That's the strawman version of the Blue TX theory. Us true believers in blue TX have been setting expectations clear since 2008 when the trend first started to reveal itself. We said ""keep working for a blue TX, keep pushing, and in twenty years or so it'll pay off."" It's not something that can be proven/disproven within a single election cycle; that hasn't been the case for any other state that flipped from red to blue, and that's certainly not gonna be the case with TX.",1,1723486398.0,joy

However, these accusations have been widely debunked. Videos and photos from the events in question, such as the rally at Detroit Metropolitan Airport, confirm the presence of large crowds, contradicting Trump's claims.

LOL, this isn’t about protecting the integrity of the election; it’s about protecting his own bruised ego from the fact that he’s being outpaced by a candidate he’s spent years trying to belittle. It’s a desperate and laughable attempt to stay relevant in a race that’s slipping away from him.

It's the entire GOP strategy distilled into a single move. Gaslight, Obstruct, Project. Let’s not forget — this is the same guy who’s been caught red-handed trying to strong-arm officials into “finding” votes and spinning wild fantasies about rigged elections. They accuse others of what they’re guilty of — because it’s easier to point fingers than to own up to their BS. 

What Trump's really doing is showing his hand, revealing just how scared he is of being outclassed by someone who doesn’t need to invent crowds to feel important.",1,1723500218.0,joy

It may seem bizarre, but let me repeat this... A candidate for president of the USA could be convicted and, if appropriate, imprisoned for election interference and this would in no way shape or form render them ineligible or disqualify them.

The only relevant issues are the three requirements and the one true disqualifier which SCOTUS recently declared can only be enacted by Congress.

But to your point... Trump has been convicted of a crime that was related to election interference.  Furthermore, he has two other separate court cases underway pertaining to actions well beyond election interference.

If Trump believes that based on the mere unsubstantiated claim of fraudulent pictures being sufficient for disqualification, then Trump himself must be disqualified.

Same deal with the military attacks on Walz. The only play Trump has in his playbook is this obfuscation, projection, muddying the waters, gaslighting...whatever you want to call it.

"> There is a growing sense that Vance may be the exception, however. As the race tightens—and Harris is leading in several polls—it’s becoming clear that Donald Trump has slowed down considerably over the last four years. He is very old. He struggles to hold his thoughts together, even by his own standards. And he has considerably less energy than he did even a few years ago. He can’t campaign vigorously. Which means he will have to rely on his running mate—whom everyone seems to hate.

> Vance was chosen under the assumption that they were headed toward a landslide victory and therefore it really wouldn’t matter, even by the standards of vice presidential picks. Running against an 81-year-old incumbent who struggled to string two sentences together, Vance was probably a fine pick. Voters and the media weren’t really going to focus on him; Democrats had bigger problems to worry about. Vance would be fine.

> Running against Harris and not Biden, however, means that they are engaged in a real campaign. And Vance’s weaknesses are far more glaring than they were previously.

"When it became clear that he had picked the [worst running mate](https://newrepublic.com/article/184286/jd-vance-worst-vice-presidential-pick-ever) in American political history, Donald Trump shrugged it off. The fact that J.D. Vance was inexperienced, extreme, and generally off-putting wouldn’t matter because vice presidents don’t. **“Historically, the vice president, in terms of the election, does not have any impact,” Trump** [**said**](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/02/jd-vance-vp-picks-00172526) when asked about Vance during his [disastrous interview](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/31/trump-nabj-black-journalists-chicago) at the National Association of Black Journalists conference earlier this month. “I mean, virtually no impact.… Virtually never has it mattered.”

Vance, for what it’s worth, [echoed Trump](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/02/jd-vance-vp-picks-00172526) soon after, albeit in a characteristically more pathetic way. “My attitude is, it doesn’t really matter, as much as this is a hit to my ego,” Vance said. “People are going to vote primarily for Donald Trump or for Kamala Harris. That’s the way these things go. I think my job over the next few months is to just drive home the message that Kamala Harris has been a bad vice president, she’d be a worse president.”

We won’t know what Vance’s impact is for a long time yet—and even then, we likely won’t be able to say with any sense of certainty. But he and Trump are almost certainly right. Vice presidential picks [don’t matter](https://newrepublic.com/article/184214/kamala-harris-vp-pick-matter-not-way-think). Even the ones you think matter didn’t really. In 2008, Sarah Palin was a bad pick—and one that got markedly worse after the housing crisis began—and Joe Biden was a good one. But neither shifted the race. There is little evidence that vice presidents move vote tallies in their home states, let alone nationally. Vance might be a little creepy, and he certainly draws attention to Trump’s bad judgment, old age, and general extremism, but voters already know that Trump is old, extreme, and more than a little crazy.

One reason that vice presidents don’t make a difference, moreover, is that presidential candidates draw more attention from both the media and the public and, during a busy campaign season, are basically always doing something to garner attention. Trump, a one-man free media machine, has never struggled here. Vance might pop up every now and then because a comment endorsing a national abortion ban surfaced or because he’s bragging about telling his young son to [“shut the hell up about Pikachu”](https://x.com/patriottakes/status/1819404693564445006) but would fade away just as quickly. Right?

There is a growing sense that Vance may be the exception, however. As the race tightens—and Harris is [leading](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/09/us-election-polls-kamala-harris-trump) in several polls—it’s becoming clear that Donald Trump has [slowed down considerably](https://newrepublic.com/post/184690/cognitive-decline-experts-find-evidence-trumps-mind-slowing) over the last four years. He is very old. He struggles to hold his thoughts together, even by his own standards. And he has considerably less energy than he did even a few years ago. He [can’t campaign vigorously](https://newrepublic.com/post/184720/trump-campaign-schedule-august-mental-fitness).

">Because Trump is the center of Trumpism and its main engine and because he is, relatedly, a malignant narcissist, his movement lacks any real potential surrogates. There are plenty of hangers-on and people who will happily say insane shit as warm-up acts. But there aren’t actual stand-ins. Vance is going to become that as Trump stays off the trail.

I can tell you from experience working in the political ad industry, from the moment Trump ran in 2016 he has cost everyone involved so much money. It was assumed he would lose in 2016 and the money dried up. Since 2019 he has neutered the down ballot races because everyone is donating to him and the money isn't being shared like it normally would. When the new PAC was formed in 20/21 he vacuumed up even more. 

It's pretty evident when you see the results, given the House/Senate/Pres has been lost under his leadership. The only reason why the Rs took the house in 22 by the slimmest of majorities was because of gerrymandering. The donor class might have gotten what they wanted out of him, but he's prevented people from keeping or attaining office. And when his extremist supporters win their primaries a majority of them have lost.

Romney had his version of the ACA in Massachusetts and would have swung more independents and moderates by campaigning on “I did this first and it wasn’t so stupidly complex. I can fix it.” Instead he made the mystery meat offering of repeal and replace with no identification of the replacement. 

Ditching core principles and ideals undermined them.

*****
> New polling data suggests that Republican vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance is growing in unpopularity among voters as time goes on, likely due to the electorate learning more about his far right views, which they may not have known about previously.

> The Blueprint poll confirms other surveys that have similarly showcased how, as voters learn more about Vance and his past statements, they become less enthralled by him as a candidate.

> Vance has also perpetuated other false theories and conspiracies, including the xenophobic belief that the Biden administration was &quot;Punishing&quot; people for not supporting him, when he was still the Democratic nominee for president, by allowing more migrants into the country - a sentiment of Vance&#039;s that more than 6 in 10 voters, according to the Data for Progress poll, also rejected.

"It's really not more complicated than this, at the end of the day. 

Trump needs money - his ""business empire"" seems perilously close to collapsing and he likely saw the Thiel/Musk money as a means to prevent the collapse long enough to get back into the White House, when all bets would be off. 

Picking Vance was how he got access to this money, so pick Vance he did. It probably didn't hurt that Vance likely said all kind of effusively ass-kissing things to Trump, but it also probably wasn't super necessary, either. 

Had Biden not dropped out, this whole plan likely would've worked - Trump would've either won the election outright or it would've been close enough for a lot of those ratfucking plans at the state level to work. 

But now... now it's a whole different ballgame. I don't take anything for granted and I certainly am not complacent, but things suddenly look a whole lot sunnier for the Democrats and now Vance looks like an even more ridiculous pick than he did before.",1,1723487984.0,joy

There's such a disconnect between the two of them, its like they are not even on the same ticket. I'm sure that's because they aren't campaigning together, but between Trump's meltdowns and Vance's inability to appear normal, the relationship seems even more distant and strange than even Trump and Pence did. At least back then Trump was a tad bit more charismatic, and as wooden as Pence was he mostly stayed in Trump's shadow, and Pence was the ""normal"" statesman to Trump's carnival barker personality.

That truth was more attractive to the rabid MAGA base than Dems that win elections when people are motivated and turn out to vote. 

Dems correctly took the temperature of the situation and realized that they were in trouble. Biden stepped aside in a selfless and correct move. The GOP has no hope of this happening. Trump is a narcissist and will never give up power. He is literally running to keep himself out of prison. 

To use an analogy, Joe Biden is the good natured grandfather willing to accept that he's aging. He was eventually willing to give up the car keys when faced with the facts. Trump is the old man who will threaten to remove his kids from his will if they even suggest he shouldn't be driving. They're willing to risk the lives of other people on the road rather than confront him. Trump won't give up his keys up until the legal system gets involved and deems him unfit.

"No one has been able to motivate the MAGA people like Trump, if he can't win with MAGA in 2024, his replacements won't win with a half motivated MAGA. Religion has been on the decline for a long time, so the Christian Conservative base shrinks each year.

Attitudes on taxes, social programs, etc can change over time, but pro-choice, LGBTQ acceptance of Millennials and Gen-Z aren't going to change as they age so they'll just keep losing more and more on social issues each year. 

Trans-panic was their last gasp since older Millennials and Gen-X didn't really grow up with an understanding of trans identities, but there isn't really a more marginalized group to switch to like when the switch to trans-panic after they finally lost on gay marriage and adoption. With the rate of change on that, they won't get decades out of that bigotry like they did with gay-rights.

Maybe they can try the socially liberal fiscally conservative thing, but that just removes the outrage motivation of their base and the established politicians have too much history of the bigotry for it to convince moderate Dems to switch.

They never released the RNC stuff. So it's easy to imagine that they're much juicier and could be used for blackmail. Right after the hacking a few GOP bigwigs went to Russia on the 4th of July and all of a sudden the party took a shift towards Russia

Trump has had known business dealings with Russia for I believe decades and we know trump likes to wax poetic about Putin. So if trump has dirt on everyone my guess is it's because putin has dirt and is willing to share with Donnie as long as he stays in line

Bowman was almost as strange as Cori Bush.  

Getting them out of Congress is actually a huge victory for the left because they were making the left seem like terrorist sympathizers; they were clown candidates.  The Republicans have a lot of clown candidates too, but they can never get rid of them (see MTG).

IMHO, the real money game that needs to be investigated is the one that media agencies are playing to increase ad dollars. Click-bait headlines do exactly that; get clicks.   That seems to be how we measure how ‘good’ a network is these days, as opposed to accuracy.  Address the excessive financial motivation to add spin, and watch all these news agencies change their approach. 

And/or, hold the agencies ACTUALLY accountable for sharing mis or disinformation.  Not just a 3/4 billion dollar settlement and firing a famous bobble head: perhaps also suspension of a broadcast license or something that will truly help to prevent it from happening again.

I'm defending the vote, not her. Republicans, some of them, approved the legislation because, given the decrepit state of US infrastructure, it cuts into business profits. Preventing profit loss is literally all the Republican Party exists for. So they stripped out the parts of the bill that wouldn't be profitable and left the parts that would, which is why it got some Republican approval. I'm just more explicit about the problem.

But I don't know if you saw the now-deleted post that kicked this discussion off, which was *full* of the most obvious, awful anti-Semitic tropes (most notably the dual-loyalty libel). And I don't think it's unfair to say that using classic anti-Semitic rhetoric in a post attacking AIPAC is *prima facie* evidence of what is really meant.",1,1723476813.0,anger

NVM they keep it going below.",1,1723479779.0,anger
"> Some are loyal to Israel and not the US.

Blatant, utter, unambiguous anti-Semitism.",1,1723475302.0,love

“Some Jewish Americans are loyal to Israel and not the US” is an insanely antisemetic statement",1,1723479848.0,love
