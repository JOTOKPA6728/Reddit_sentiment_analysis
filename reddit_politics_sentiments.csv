# Trump’s Plane Grounded After Emergency Landing—Now He’s Flying Jeffrey Epstein’s Jet

>The 16-passeger, 2008 model aircraft, was acquired by Epstein in 2013 and was used primarily to fly between Palm Beach, Manhattan, Paris and the US Virgin Islands. Here are redacted customs records for the aircraft. While it was the aircraft used by Epstein prior to his final arrest and death, it was not the ‘Lolita Express’ which was an older Boeing 727.

>While an aircraft that was sold during the pandemic, and available for charter, it seems like a great failure of vetting by the Trump campaign not just because of Epstein’s history (and the nefarious uses of the aircraft itself) but because of Trump’s own past association with Epstein – associations which, to be clear, were notoriously bipartisan.

Watch if you have 15. JD Vance just is so WEIRD. Like he doesn't even want to pretend to be likeable. I know he is gone down the rabbit hole, but its like slowly watching someone morph into this inhuman bob-it who has only been programmed with 5 responses. He is the real face of the Trump campaign since Donny wont leave his club and its gross. Its like Project 2025 became a human. 

Transcript: 

VANCE: Well, first of all, Dana, my heart breaks for this woman. I don't know her personally. I have certainly heard the story and our heart breaks for her. And we want people to have healthy, happy families. And it's extremely unfortunate that sometimes, you know, medicine, the act of God, whatever, happens, it just doesn't work out.  
  
And what the president has said, I think, very clearly, is that he is not trying to prevent women who have nonviable pregnancies from getting access to the medical care that they...  
  
BASH: But allowing...  
  
VANCE: ... need.  
  
BASH: But allowing the states to decide, a place like Texas, which has very strict laws now, doesn't allow a Kate Cox to end a pregnancy that is fatal and could potentially hurt her ability to have more kids.  
  
VANCE: Well, but what President Trump has said is that we are going to let voters make these decisions. And, again, Texas might have a view that President Trump disagrees with. They might have a view that President Trump agrees with, but you've got to let the voters make these decisions.  
  
BASH: So you're comfortable...  
  
VANCE: And ultimately...  
  
BASH: ... with that law in Texas?  
  
VANCE: I'm not comfortable with anything, Dana, because I'm not passing judgment on what these laws should be.  
  
Now, you asked me my own personal view. I campaigned against an Ohio referendum. But I think that we have to let voters decide. And when they speak their mind, you have to be respectful. Agree or disagree, with whatever voters decide, they're going to make these decisions.",14,1723475909.0,sadness

What the eventual plan is, I'm not sure.  I know Trump and the Republicans like Hungary's president Orban.  He found the way to change the goddamned constitution so that he gets to stay in power, since what, 2010?  Hungary is considered a 'failed democracy'.

"As someone who worked at Blizzard on big data live ops and auth systems at Battle.net. I can tell you that DDoS attacks do happen and were typical for major global launches - that being said - people do not realize how difficult supporting concurrent live connections is - if you didn’t properly forecast you were kinda screwed. Our server leads said it was like preparing to get hit with a tsunami - you can control the damage and recover more quickly but you are still gonna get hit with a tsunami.

Imagine building a 6 lane highway but it turns out 12 lanes worth of cars tried to get on. Your first problem isn’t even the highway it’s the on ramp.

Primarily, it’s very easy to DDoS a login end-point which was typically the failure point for Blizzard services. Adding lanes to your highway doesn’t help much if people can’t get on. Which is usually why Blizzard resorted to login queues to solve it.
Millions of concurrent connections is not close to the same thing as asynchronous connections. It’s hard stuff for anyone - much less a team who is a shadow of their former engineering talent…

Circling back to Twitter. They did probably DDoS themselves because to everyone’s correct observation- DDoS attacks need to be able to target a service or endpoint and overwhelm it with junk traffic. Since all of Twitter didn’t go down and the service was simply struggling - far more likely that their infrastructure just wasn’t prepared for 1M+ concurrent connections. Especially with no gating or queuing mechanism to control the influx.

To be honest, I think it’s easy to say big numbers and not recognize how staggering it is. Even 1 million people is so many people. Blizzard’s endpoints were capable of millions of requests per second but a DDoS cheaply and easily can generate 10s of millions of requests a second and you need to find a way to separate junk from real requests (easy enough with IPs and certain signatures) but you can’t really “prepare” until it’s happening.

Common tactic. Sometimes…but it’s also true that it’s way easier and cheaper to create a DDoS then defend against one. Also true - as I suspect with Twitter that they just don’t have the infrastructure to support the amount of people who tuned in. My guess is that they solved it by simply capping the concurrent connections. I bet people got disconnected constantly and audio quality dipped pretty hard.",1,1723514677.0,joy

"Trump accused Harris of using artificial intelligence to fake crowd sizes at her rallies, claiming that this constitutes ""election interference"" and should disqualify her from the race. His allegations are that Harris digitally manipulated images to show large crowds at her events, which he claims did not exist. He's using these unfounded claims to suggest that Harris is cheating in the election process.

However, these accusations have been widely debunked. Videos and photos from the events in question, such as the rally at Detroit Metropolitan Airport, confirm the presence of large crowds, contradicting Trump's claims.

LOL, this isn’t about protecting the integrity of the election; it’s about protecting his own bruised ego from the fact that he’s being outpaced by a candidate he’s spent years trying to belittle. It’s a desperate and laughable attempt to stay relevant in a race that’s slipping away from him.

It's the entire GOP strategy distilled into a single move. Gaslight, Obstruct, Project. Let’s not forget — this is the same guy who’s been caught red-handed trying to strong-arm officials into “finding” votes and spinning wild fantasies about rigged elections. They accuse others of what they’re guilty of — because it’s easier to point fingers than to own up to their BS.

> Republicans have previously criticized the Biden administration for flying immigrants away from the border after they&#039;ve been let into the country, a criticism that often overlooks the fact that many of these immigrants are children who cannot be legally kept in border detention facilities for more than 72 hours-a law that was also in place during the Trump administration, according to The Washington Post.

"Oof, thing is, the TONE is really different in this photo too. First photo just looked like a Halloween photo, like maybe he lost a bet or dressed up and was being silly and someone snapped a photo. Truly nothing of note if not for the GOP making any sort of gender exploration into a moral panic issue.

But this one? This one leads me to believe the dress up may have been \*actual\* gender exploration, not just a lost bet or a Halloween costume. Why? He's not smiling.

If it was a lost bet or a costume, these photos would probably have him smiling or looking bashful or exasperated at the camera, for example. But this photo? This photo looks sincere. This looks like someone with not a lot of resources (see the cheap Halloween wig) trying out a bit of glamour, exploring ideas of beauty which btw, my heart absolutely goes out to and I would vigorously defend this person from mockery on those grounds.

Even if the conclusion was that he's cis and straight, there's no harm and a lot of good that comes from this sort of exploration. And also consider, Vance isn't conventionally attractive and certainly wasn't then either, so my heart really goes out to someone who wants to explore feeling ""pretty"" and what that means for them.

Vance isn't smiling in this because he's trying to look pretty. These are exploratory photos, there's no smiling, to silliness, the blond wig is awful but that's no fault of someone who doesn't have a lot of money or access. Those clothes look borrowed too, likely from a friend, lending further to the sense of sincere experimentation rather than a Halloween costume (with a Halloween costume, it's more likely you'd wear a cocktail dress or something with a lower neckline, y'know?). This is Vance exploring what Girl Vance would look like and exploring feminine beauty.

\*Sigh\* Again, apologies for the wall of text, but I would have a lot of sympathy for this person and what I think this photo was intended for, a private moment of self exploration and reflection, if not for all the heinous shit and hypocrisy coming out of the GOP he props up right now.

Everyone should be free to safely explore their gender. And to transition if that is what they discover. But we live in a culture that makes that very hard, and people like Vance and the Republican party want to make it harder.  The result is a vicious circle. You get people like Vance whose own inner turmoil can be weaponized against others.  They live in a hostile, cruel reality they created.

Perhaps after forcing himself into that mold he feels the need to inflict it on others, since if he has to live a life that makes him unhappy, other should too. Or perhaps not! Perhaps that's giving him too much credit. 

Regardless, it does feel inescapable though that these photos indicate there's some level of self-loathing, deceit, or at the very least hypocrisy at play in his image and rhetoric.

"Yeah I don't see ""drag"" here either. There's no flamboyance, as you noted, and not sense of ""fun"" let alone mockery. The high neckline, jewelry, long skirt, etc. likewise to me ring of someone dressing as a woman, possibly the woman they want to be or woman they want to experiment at being, rather than a parody or costume of femininity.

It definitely reminded me of some early exploratory photos by trans women before they come out. In happier timelines, in happier stories, those photos are usually part of the ""early days"" when what looks like a dead-eyed young man who is absolutely miserable with ""his"" life blossoms into an absolutely gorgeous woman who loves her life. (In reference to a more widespread meme I saw to the effect of ""Before/After Photos"" where it's other trans women celebrating and noting how much happier they and others look after transitioning from that ""dead eyed young ""man"" in a hoodie"" to a stunning, happy, contented woman brimming with life, but the full glow-up almost always comes after a few early pictures of clumsy, shy, but sincere explorations as seen in photos like Vance's above). 

Anyway, at risk of another wall of text, I just wanted to agree with you. If you squint, you absolutely see the sort of Instagram pretty girl glamour photo attempt here which is completely harmless and perhaps even deeply meaningful to someone who is exploring their identity and concepts of beauty. I don't see mockery here. Then again, maybe another photo will come out and it will become clear that this all was some sort of joke or horsing around and I'm reading way too much into it. But until then, so far the 2 data points I've seen indicate the opposite.

"It certainly lends credibility to the stereotype that many conservatives are closeted and feel they have to remain that way either in order to gain/keep power or because their culture/upbringing shames them out of ever coming out.

Many of even the most conservative cultures throughout history have a culture of dressing up as the opposite sex for fun, be it Ancient Greek comedy plays, Medieval festivals, or even drag shows as entertainment by  US soldiers \*for\* other soldiers in WWII, and it's a testament to how absolutely loony-tunes nuts the right wing has become in the US that a form of expression as old as humanity itself (like drag) is a reason for hysterical moral panic.

Eh, Tolkien was an Oxford-educated English professor by the time he started publishing; that sort of pedigree was about as close as you could get to a built-in following at the time (and still opens plenty of doors today). And there are still plenty of fantasy authors doing quite well with baggy, world building-heavy series now, too, although Tolkien’s influence on the genre is impossible to overstate. 

Also worth noting that he published The Hobbit first, which is a *way* tighter story arc with better pacing than LOTR. And he only submitted it in the first place because his buddy CS Lewis thought it had commercial appeal, so that was a huge foot in the door.",1,1723496374.0,joy

"After “Trump Force One” had some mechanical issues—because, of course, his personal plane is as reliable as his grasp on reality—Trump’s campaign decided to charter another aircraft. And wouldn’t you know it, they ended up with Epstein’s Gulfstream G550. It’s almost poetic.

The Trump campaign claims they had no idea about the plane’s history, which is a bit hard to swallow considering Epstein’s name isn’t exactly a footnote in American history. But let’s give them the benefit of the doubt — maybe they didn’t know. Still, it’s a hell of a coincidence, isn’t it? Trump, who was chummy with Epstein back in the day until their relationship reportedly soured over a real estate deal, now unknowingly boards a plane that once belonged to the disgraced financier. You couldn’t script this level of irony if you tried.

Naturally, the campaign has now instructed the charter company to avoid using Epstein’s former jet in the future. But the damage is done. The optics of this are a nightmare, and it reignites all those uncomfortable discussions about Trump’s past association with Epstein.

I can't tell him great things happening to me without him coming at it with a right wing slant. It's unbearable, so I've kind of cut him out of my life. He HAS to talk about big social issues happening in other countries. He HAS to read the news headlines aloud on Yahoo/Fox and ask what I think about them. We can be having a beer on the back patio during my rare visit back home and he has to bring up how his job is making them do unnecessary workplace sensitivity training...

I told him a few months ago I got a promotion at work and I was very happy about it. He said congrats and it's good I got the promotion since the cost of everything is going up and illegal immigrants are going to be taking more jobs, making it more difficult for REAL americans to stay gainfully employed. I told him a few months later we bought a house and he said congrats BUT I should've listened to him and waited to buy a house when there was a Republican president since the rates will be better. Like holy shit, just be happy for me.

I have a sliver of hope for this election though - he voted for Haley in the Rep. primary and seemed the slightest bit receptive to change when Biden withdrew. I am hopeful I can convince him to vote for the candidate that will provide a more optimistic future for my child, his grandchild.

I'm 35, AMAB, and married my husband last year.  My parents still don't know.  They might put on an accepting act to our faces when we still had contact, but they made it clear they were always going to vote R.

No matter how many times I told them that they wanted to take my rights away.  My mother straight up told me ""they would never do, they don't have any reason to!""  Then when they straight up put that on their platform ""well they can't!""  Then when Roe was overturned... ""Oh, that's good, actually, because now it's up to states!  Besides, my high school boyfriend was traumatized after he cheated on me by the girl he cheated on me with aborting their baby, so abortion is bad!""  I desperately wish I could say that last bit was exaggerated.  The last few years have been exceptionally bad, and combined with some other stuff... I haven't talked to them in... nearly a year now?

I just can't accept someone claiming to love me, but putting my rights and safety below ""stopping illegals"".

Walz reminds me a lot of the good parts of my dad.  Plain spoken.  Seems exactly the sort to say ""you get me the manual and the parts and I'll fix your car for free"" for friends.  A little goofy, the kind of guy you *know* mooned some people in high school.

Ladies and Gentlemen,



Today, as we stand beneath the expansive skies of our great nation, we are called upon not just to remember the values that once propelled America to the forefront of the world but to act on them. We are the beacon of democracy in a challenging landscape, confronting issues of dictatorship, genocide, and greed. Our response to these challenges will define us for generations to come.



We must safeguard the legacy of innovation, industry, medicine, art, and science—a legacy that is anchored not in the whims of popularity but in unwavering moral courage and decisive action. Our ambition is to be a nation where every individual is valued for their character, where our actions reflect our commitment to lead with integrity both at home and on the global stage.



We have built more than infrastructure in our past; we have laid down the foundations for a society that thrives on justice and prosperity. Yet today, we must face a critical question: Are we living up to the promise of our heritage? Have we allowed the discord of division to silence our better angels?



We must rise above the cynicism and despair that threaten to diminish our spirit. This is not a moment for stepping back but for stepping up, embracing the hard roads that define true leadership, because that is how we forge a future worthy of our past.



Let us recommit ourselves to greatness, driven not by the pursuit of easy victories but by the relentless pursuit of high ideals. This is the promise of America—a promise that says no challenge is too great, no dream too bold if we are united in our effort.



And so, as we move forward, let us channel the spirit of those who chose to go to the moon not because it was easy, but because it was hard, because that goal served to organize and measure the best of their energies and skills. Today, our moonshots are different—climate change, social inequality, educational and technological advancement—but they are no less crucial. They demand the best of us, and we will meet them with the same determination.



Let us not be content with the world as it is; let us be architects of the world as it should be. If we come together, if we listen to one another, we can achieve extraordinary things. We’ve been reminded that change doesn’t come from Washington but to Washington. The most enduring changes are those that come from the power of the people, the strength of our collective will to pursue a brighter tomorrow.



Thank you, and may our shared efforts continue to light the path toward a promising future for the United States of America.",1,1723489701.0,joy

"It’s great to see story like this so high up in the comments. People simplify the division in our country by saying “only idiots vote for Trump/GOP”. We aren’t winning people over by calling people names and we’re also vastly oversimplifying the issue.

My parents are both baptists with masters degrees. Both are New England conservatives, so relative to the rest of the country fairly moderate. My mother even had 2 masters degrees in the field of psychology.

They were reluctant Trump voters in 2016. They just voted for him in the name of “fiscal conservatism”. Since they’ve been retired for the last 4 years though, it’s gotten way worse.

They have thankfully always followed the medical science on COVID but yet they give “injecting disinfectant straight into the body” the excuse of “just a verbal slip up”. 

When January 6th happened I talked to them on the phone and they were outraged. A few days later they were talking about how it was staged by Antifa…

You can tell them straight to their face that they are hearing lies on the news and my dad has legit said to me “they wouldn’t do that” or “they couldn’t get away with that”. They believe Christians and conservatives are “honest hard working Americans”. Being misled like Putin misleads Russians just simply couldn’t happen here in their minds. 

There’s no amount of logic or facts you can use to get them to change a political view, but that’s been the case for a very long time. What’s changed is the extremism and prevalence of those views and their willingness to share them.

The only thing I’ve really made *any* traction on with my father is EVS. He parroted some right wing “EVs catch on fire” memes to me and I went on to explain that I had literally been professionally reading and doing research in the field of reliability and texting of lithium ion batteries as an engineer and could explain things in detail. I told him it was deeply insulting to me that he’d rather listen to a blowhard pundit on TV or some internet meme over his own son who is a scientist and an engineer. He did eventually accept that EVs are reliable, that EVs are somewhat inevitable but it’s only a partially victory because he still says “we still need to drill more and produce more gas vehicles”. He accepts the facts they just don’t really change how he views the world.


The problem isn’t lack of intelligence or compassion. The problem is an emotional one. These people have a world view and an identity. Part of that world view may be being a Christian, a conservative, or a “real American”. Maybe it’s being “fiscally responsible”. That world view believes in American exceptionalism, in freedom, in freedom of speech, and the idea that people are fundamentally honest. It’s deeply engrained and it’s very powerful…

So it doesn’t matter if I tell them facts and get them to agree with my logic. As Einstein said , “A problem can only be solved at the same logical level it was created.” To really change their mind they need to *feel differently* about the world and that is fundamentally a much harder thing to do. This is an emotional problem centered around one’s ego and world view.

I’ve seen the same exact scenario of being able to listen to the facts but being unable to change their perspective when it comes to the topic of mental health. They will accept I have depression and ADHD but they can’t really accept the meaning of that because really truly emotionally accepting it challenges their world view too much. My point is, it’s not just politics.

Right wing media uses fear and it constantly sells the message that their world view and their lifestyle are under attack. They then believe that they are staying true to their beliefs and being courageous standing up for those beliefs. To change their views they need to be willing to change their perception of the world and of themselves and unfortunately that is so so much harder than just sharing facts and using logic.",1,1723491028.0,anger

Which means that pretty much every biologist, paleontologist, geologist, etc., all of whom are experts in their field far beyond his very smart layman's understanding, is either grossly incompetent or intentionally lying. And so are most astrophysicists, including the ones who established things he knows to be true, like the speed of light or fundamental forces like gravity. 

The light we see from other galaxies has been travelling for millions of years to reach our telescopes. His solution to this conflict in what he believes and knows to be true? God must have created the light travelling in between galaxies at the same time as the galaxies themselves, six thousand years ago. 

Why would God do that, except to ""fool"" us into thinking the universe is much older than it is? Why wouldn't God simply allow the fundamental principles He established to play out rationally, so we'd have an expanding perspective on the universe approximately 6000 light years around us, only going further as the millennia pass? 

""I'm just a man, I don't understand everything about God. If I did, I'd be God."" 

It's infuriating to know that there are plenty of people who've been able to allow their spiritual beliefs to co-exist with real science using that same argument.

I'm sure I would turn into one of them too if I spent my days watching fox news and browsing only hate filled subs that bolster my ego.

> Former President Donald Trump&#039;s campaign flew in a blue Gulfstream jet formerly owned by sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, using it to travel to several campaign fundraisers over the weekend, the Miami Herald has confirmed.

> There are numerous photographs of Trump and Epstein together in the 1990s, long before Epstein was arrested on solicitation charges in Palm Beach.

> Although tens of thousands of pages of documents have been unsealed in various Epstein civil cases, none of the documents released to date have credibly implicated Trump in Epstein&#039;s trafficking crimes.

Trump’s campaign has been notorious for flaking on bills for security. According to a 2019 report from the Center for Public Integrity, Trump owed more than $840,000 to various city governments, and likely more, as Trump’s campaign does not acknowledge a single one of these city governments as debt in his federal campaign financial disclosures. 

In Billings, the protective measures put in place for his September 2018 rally resulted in 1,362 overtime hours between Billings PD and the Yellowstone County Sheriff’s office: 951 hours from the former, and 411 hours from the latter, bringing the total cost to $58,830. 

While the Yellowstone Sheriff’s office did not bill Trump’s campaign for the $12,930 cost it incurred – a standard practice the office follows for all political campaigns – Billings PD did, and as of the publication date of this article, that $45,900 bill has been left unpaid.",1,1723501201.0,sadness

I don't dispute this. It is indeed funny and ironic. 

>He deserves the spin on the story

No one deserves negative spins on things solely to rile people up. People deserve factual reporting. 

>some pretty good reasons to believe he took advantage of Epstein’s underage offerings.

In liberals minds, yes. In conservatives minds no. In reality, we live in a country where we are innocent until proven guilty and that guilt requires actual evidence. If that comes out then he absolutely deserves prison time. Though sex crimes are tough to prove, especially years after the crime so it's doubtful many will fave any prison from the Epstein files.

"Indeed. I still believe this journalism is mentally unhealthy. It is right up there putting an airframe on the same pedestal as a book where some fascist thinks burning a book will make a difference. It is weak, feeble mindedness.  Either let's believe the thing itself (airframe) is intrinsically affected as an inanimate object imbued with the essence of pedophilia or let's believe it is just mostly aluminum.

I guess the thing is that airplanes are durable and last a very long time, cost a lot of money and are not all that numerous.  You don't throw one in the scrap heap they way you tear down a house that had a murder in it.
